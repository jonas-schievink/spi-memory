//! An `embedded-hal`-based SPI-Flash chip driver.
//!
//! This crate aims to be compatible with common families of SPI flash chips.
//! Currently, reading 25-series chips is supported, and support for writing and
//! erasing as well as other chip families (eg. 24-series chips) is planned.
//! Contributions are always welcome!
